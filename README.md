# civ1-wonder

A collection of `Rule`s to handle the cost and effects of `Wonder`s in-line with Civ 1.

## TODO

Fix `JsBachsCathedral` so that it paths from the checked `City` to the `City` that contains it.
Implement all the missing benefits:

- `ApolloProgram`
- `DarwinsVoyage`
- `GreatWall`
- `HooverDam`
- `IsaacNewtonsCollege`
- `ManhattanProject`
- `Pyramids`
- `UnitedNations`
